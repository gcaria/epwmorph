# epwmorph
 This package can be used to morph EnergyPlus weather files following Belcher et al. (2005) and using bias corrected 
 CMIP6 climate model output ensembles. A configuration text file is provided to set parameters and I have made my best 
 effort to provide clear print statements. 
 
 The entire package should be run from a single command "main.py" after tuning the configuration file. The proccessing 
 follows Figure 1.
